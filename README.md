# Writing and Resources

This repository contains markdown documents of writing on a variety of topics encountered while working on programming projects, and also includes copies of various academic papers and book chapters which were referenced or used to complete that work. The [references](./references/) directory contains copies of academic texts and PDF's maintained for continued reference as they are being used in ongoing projects, and are not my original work and are for academic use only.
